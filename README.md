# prntScrapper



## Description

Simple batch script to scrape prnt.sc. Downloads images from randomly generated valid URLs. No API is used, only wget
prnt.sc is a image hosting website generally used to store printscreens. Often these printscreens contain private information. Hence this scrapper, to alert people of their exposed private details. Because, obviously, this is for educational purposes only


### Dependencies

* Needed: wget
* OS: Linux

### Executing the script

* ./prntScrapper.sh [number of images to scrape] 

```
prntScrapper 100
```

## Help

If any URL fails, it's mostly likely due to the print not existing anymore. If that's not the case please send me the main.log
